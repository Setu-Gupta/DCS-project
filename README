Python3 Dependencies:
        1. Numpy
        2. Matplotlib
        3. Math
        4. Random
        5. Copy
        6. Argparse
        7. Sys
        8. Multiprocessing
        9. Queue

How to run:
        1. Go to the individual plot directories and then select a decoder to run.
                $ cd plotX/DECODER_CHOICE
        2. Run the plot generation script
                $ python3 csv_gen.py <number of threads to use> <output CSV file name>
                Example: $ python3 csv_gen.py 17 ./out.csv

How to plot the results:
        1. Go to the plotter script directory
                $ cd plotter
        2. Run the plotter script help
                $ python3 plotter.py -h
        3. Run with the appropriate arguments to generate a plot
                Example: $ python3 plotter.py -s ../plot1/belief_prop/out.csv t1 -t belief -x SNR -y log10\(BER\) -l -g
        Note that an example CSV file and the corresponding plot for it is given in the plotter directory to help you get started.
        The format of the CSV file is written in plotter.py

How to automate the experiments:
        Simply run the executor.sh script which will collect all the data automatically.

The code for plotter, csv generators and utilities is very well documented. Please refer to the python files to get an idea of how the code works.
NOTE: All the references which inspired to code are mentioned in the comments in the python files
